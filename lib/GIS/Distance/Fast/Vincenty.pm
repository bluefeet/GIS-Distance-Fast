=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Fast::Vincenty - C implementation of GIS::Distance::Vincenty.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<GIS::Distance::Vincenty> for details about this formula.

The results from L<GIS::Distance::Vincenty> versus this module are slightly
different.  I'm still not sure why this is, as the C code is nearly identical to
the Perl code.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula modules.
