=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty::Fast - C implementation of GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used by L<GIS::Distance> and has the same API as
L<GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty>.

=head1 NOTES

The results from Formula::Vincenty versus Formula::Vincenty::Fast are slightly
different.  I'm still not sure why this is, as the C code is nearly identical to
the Perl code.
