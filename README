NAME
    GIS::Distance::Fast - C implementation of GIS::Distance formulas.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution re-implements some, but not all, of the formulas that
    come with GIS::Distance in the C programming language. C code is
    generally much faster than the perl equivilent.

    In most of my testing I've found that the C version of the formulas
    outperform the Perl equivelent by at least 2x.

    This module need not be used directly. GIS::Distance will automatically
    use the ::Fast formulas when they are available.

FORMULAS
    GIS::Distance::Formula::Cosine::Fast

    GIS::Distance::Formula::Haversine::Fast

    GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty::Fast

BUGS
    The GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty::Fast produces slightly different
    results than GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty. Read the POD for
    GIS::Distance::Formula::Vincenty::Fast for details.
